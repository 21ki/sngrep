--- DISCLAIMER ----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- sngrep is a small development done in a couple of days. It has not been 
--- properly coded. It has not been propely tested. It should not even reach
--- the alpha stage, but can be handy somehow in strange cases.
---
--- If you use this piece of code and find a bug or have a comment, write them 
--- to
---					kaian@irontec.com

--- WHAT IS SNGREP?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- This 'tool' aims to make easier the task of my workmates while using ngrep
--- on heavy load production systems. When a lot of SIP messages are flowing 
--- in your screen, is useful to have a tool that order them and print in a 
--- fashion way.
---
--- This can be also used as a PCAP file viewer, although will only show SIP
--- packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- There are two ways of using sngrep
---
--- Offline mode:
---  Just pass a PCAP file as parameter, it will read all UDP SIP packages
---  and parse them in different dialogs showing their call flows when possible.
---
--- Online mode
---  You can use sngrep with the same parameters than ngrep. 
---  It will spawn a ngrep process passing the given parameters and parse its
---  output. 
---  Some parameters will make ngrep output be different from what sngrep
---  expects, making it fail. Yes, it sucks.
--- 
--- sngrep will try to group parsed messages in dialogs based on Call-ID
--- header of SIP messages.
--- 
--- If you want to make relations between different dialogs (extended callflow)
--- a header must be present in of the dialogs referencing the other one.
--- This header can be X-CID or X-Call-ID and must contain the Call-ID of the
--- other related dialog.

--- FREQUENT ASKED QUESTIONS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Q: Why a new tool from network filtering?
--- A: Don't know. I didn't find any console tool that will display call flows
---    not even in text mode.
---
--- Q: Why dont you filter packages in online mode instead of using ngrep?
--- A: Because I don't have the required time to code all that right now
---
--- Q: Why only parsing SIP Messages?
--- A: Because it's useful for us.
---
--- Q: I have found a bug, what should I do?
--- A: There are LOTS of bugs. The strange thing will be you haven't found one.
---    Just write me an email to kaian@irontec.com and will try to fix it.
---
--- Q: I think the idea is better than the tool.
--- A: I think that too. If you want to start a new tool with the same purpose
---    send me an email, I'll want to contribute.
