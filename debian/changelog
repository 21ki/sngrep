sngrep (0.1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  The main change in this release is the lack of ngrep support.
  Spawning a ngrep process was causing lots of trouble when sngrep crashed 
  (and the spawned process was still capturing data).
  Also using always a temporal file to allow saving in sngrep was filling 
  temporal dirs with lots of useless captures. We have lost some options, 
  but now we have more control over captured data.
   
  * Remove ngrep compatibility. Force libpcap during compilation
  * Added TCP support
  * Allow saving selected dialogs into pcap
  * New UI design to maximize screen usage
  * Added a serach box in Call List window
  * Added Funtion Keys keybindings
  * Added command line arguments
  * Fixed some memory bugs
