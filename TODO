ToDo List
=========

capture:
	* Add compatibility with IPv6
		Capturing and parsing IPv6 packets should not be a problem but
		all interfaces are designed for a max address length of 15
		characters so the impact in UI makes this improvement no so
		easy to implement.

    * Handle Packet fragmentation
        Right now capture process only handle packets with SIP payload,
        so if a packet is marked as fragmented, part of its payload
        will not be displayed.

sip:
	* Change parsing functions for something more efficient (osip2?)
		Parsing with sscanf is not the best way, but the simplest. If
		we require to parse more headers in the future, it will start 
		to be worse and worse
		
	* Improve the way payload is stored
		Payload is included two times. One in the msg->payload pointer
		and also in msg->pcap_packet content. This doubles the required
		memory.

ui:
 	* Change panels initialization
		Right now, all panels are initializated at the same, because
		each panel can only be invoked once (it is not possible to have
		two call details panel right now)

	* Add horizontal scrolling
		It should be nice to be able to scroll horizontaly (with unused
		right and left keys) in Call List and Call flow.

	* Interface resize
		When the terminal size changes, the ui is not properly redraw.
		It would be nice to handle KEY_RESIZE event and change all displayed
		panels.

    * Improve colors for white background terminals
        The best approach for colors should be use terminal defaults.
        Right now, white background terminals must set background dark option
        in order to see colors properly.
