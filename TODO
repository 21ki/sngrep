ToDo List
=========

capture:
    * Handle Packet fragmentation
        Right now capture process only handle packets with SIP payload,
        so if a packet is marked as fragmented, part of its payload
        will not be displayed.

	* Add command line option to capture rtp packets
		All relevant captured packets are stored in memory, so this
		option should not be enabled by default. Adding a --rtp argument
		to make sngrep store this packets for saving them will be an
		option.

sip:
	* Improve the way payload is stored
		Payload is included two times. One in the msg->payload pointer
		and also in msg->pcap_packet content. This doubles the required
		memory.

ui:
 	* Change panels initialization
		Right now, all panels are initializated at the same, because
		each panel can only be invoked once (it is not possible to have
		two call details panel right now)

	* Add horizontal scrolling
		It should be nice to be able to scroll horizontaly (with unused
		right and left keys) in Call List and Call flow.

	* Interface resize
		When the terminal size changes, the ui is not properly redraw.
		It would be nice to handle KEY_RESIZE event and change all displayed
		panels.

	* Improve Save panel
		Make save panel smarter. If you're displaying raw text, TEXT should
		be automatically selected on the save dialog. If you have selected
		multiple dialogs, 'save selected' should be the default option.
		If you're filtering dialogs, 'save filtering' should be the default
		option. If you're saving pcap and you enter .pcap in the filename,
		we should avoid adding the file prefix.

    * Improve colors for white background terminals
        The best approach for colors should be use terminal defaults.
        Right now, white background terminals must set background dark option
        in order to see colors properly.

	* Improve compatibility with IPv6
        IPv6 packets are captured but IPv6 addresses can be 45 chars
        long, so current UI is not ready to display that kind of
        addresses
