ToDo List
=========
capture:
    * Add support for TLS (At least 1.0)

sip:
    * Remove all ngrep rubbish
        We still use ngrep header format. I like that for displaying
        raw data but not for parsing data from capture packets
        into sip_message structures.

	* Change parsing functions for something more efficient (osip2?)
		Parsing with sscanf is not the best way, but the simplest. If
		we require to parse more headers in the future, it will start 
		to be worse and worse
		
ui:
 	* Change panels initialization
		Right now, all panels are initializated at the same, because
		each panel can only be invoked once (it is not possible to have
		two call details panel right now)
		
	* Show call duration and Finish status
		It would be great to show this two columns on main screean.
		First one can be calculated from the difference between first
		and last messages timestamps.
		The second one, depends on the messages in the callflow. But the
		idea is something like: BYE (Normal Clearing), CANCEL (Canceled),
		486 Busy Here (Busy), ...
