ToDo List
=========
sip:
	* Change parsing functions for something more efficient (osip2?)
		Parsing with sscanf is not the best way, but the simplest. If
		we require to parse more headers in the future, it will start 
		to be worse and worse
		
	* Improve the way payload is stored
		Payload is included two times. One in the msg->payload pointer
		and also in msg->pcap_packet content. This doubles the required
		memory.

ui:
 	* Change panels initialization
		Right now, all panels are initializated at the same, because
		each panel can only be invoked once (it is not possible to have
		two call details panel right now)
		
	* Show call duration
		It would be great to show this two columns on main screean.
		First one can be calculated from the difference between first
		and last messages timestamps.

	* Change List columns in runtime
		Sometimes its useful to filter the list for some column that is
		not being displayed (like time, transport, ...), so it would be
		nice to allow choosing the columns during runtime
